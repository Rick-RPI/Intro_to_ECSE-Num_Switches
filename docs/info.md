## How it works

Using an input of two switches, an LED will light up. The chronological order of LEDs (0, 1, 2) determine the number of switches flipped on.

## How to test

Flip the first two two switches to produce an output of 0, 1, or 2 switches being turned on.

## External hardware

Three LEDs connected at outputs 0, 1, 2.
